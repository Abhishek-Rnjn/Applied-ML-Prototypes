  - title: Churn Modeling with scikit-learn
    label: churn-prediction
    short_description: Build an scikit-learn model to predict churn using customer telco data.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression classification model to predict the probability 
      that a group of customers will churn from a fictitious telecommunications company. In addition, the model is 
      interpreted using a technique called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Both the logistic 
      regression and LIME models are deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability and interact with a 
      basic Flask-based web application.

  - title: Deep Learning for Image Analysis
    label: image-analysis
    short_description: Build a semantic search application with deep learning models.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a scalable semantic search solution
      on a dataset of images. Pretrained convolutional neural networks are used to
      extract semantically meaningful representations, which are then indexed
      using the FAISS library for scalable retrieval. Finally, the project
      launches an interactive visualization for exploring the quality of
      representations extracted using multiple model architectures.

  - title: Fraud Detection
    label: fraud-detection
    short_description: Build a model in Pytorch to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
    long_description: >-
      In this project, a fictional credit card company uses machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions 
      that should be blocked or investigated. Although the features in this dataset are abstract, in principle, post 
      hoc analysis could also surface fraud hotspots that could be communicated as an alert to customers. The techniques in 
      this use case are applicable to any situation in which most measurements or events are normal, but rare outliers 
      require attention.
